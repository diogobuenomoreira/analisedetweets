6349,0,"@m1sp hey, do you have a good way to consume multiple json dumps into a single corpus? i've been just hacking it together."
6350,0,"@m1sp er, into a single model i mean. from multiple corpuses. or whatever."
6351,0,@vex0rian @m1sp i thought it was looking at tweet ids or dates. i'm pulling from multiple user accounts.
6352,0,"@vex0rian @m1sp oh i just saw the latest version has consume-all (but help docs are bugged, btw.)"
6353,0,"@vex0rian @m1sp consume_all vs consume-all, doesn't mention model name must be first."
6354,0,"@vex0rian @m1sp yeah, i made a *bunch* of changes with the old ver, nice to see some of them aren't needed anymore. :)"
6355,0,@vex0rian @m1sp I had a bunch of commands to help manage ggautoblocker related stuff. :) also started fights between randi/gater_ebooks
6356,0,@vex0rian @m1sp it's a nice update! i quite like it.
6357,0,DevOpsing so hard right now. http://t.co/Sqz1otVsDC
6358,0,"@GregTheTerrible In web, yes. Clients other than web immediately delete tweets."
6359,0,@GregTheTerrible you should read the developer policy irt deleted tweets. It should comfort you ;)
6360,0,@dilettante thanks ;) more fun stuff coming soon.
6361,0,I hate configuring retention policies and flush intervals in statsd/graphite. Ughhhh.
6362,0,Can I make graphite show the sum of 5m when retention is 1m? Want to see a graph with point every 5m with sum of that time period.
6363,0,"@informationchef i have no idea what these mean: requestContext, seriesList. guessing intervalstring would be 5m?"
6364,0,@informationchef i haven't really had to go plonking around in graphite before. this stuff is practically a foreign language.

6368,0,Disclaimer: None of these things I'm about to tell you are 100% accurate. Just *mostly* accurate. There are always exceptions.
6369,0,"In the past 12 hrs, GG hashtag saw 1018 tweets/hr (776 of which were RTs). Min: 662 (473) Max: 1519 (1233). majority of non-RT came from bot"
6370,0,"Tweets which saw the most RTs tend to be questionable, abusive, and almost always aimed at @spacekatgal, @thequinnspiracy, @femfreq, and me."

6373,0,"When we look at all mentions of a username, including RTs, @spacekatgal has received 1611 in the past 12h. @femfreq has received 911."
6374,0,Can't wait until I get more data on this. But it looks like @spacekatgal should probably avoid her mentions at 8-10AM PDT Sundays. ;)

6382,0,@spacekatgal we could do something fun with this. i could see how many tweets you get from users you've blocked.
6383,0,The goal here is to eventually have up a pretty dashboard where you can go and see up-to-the-minute stats on this stuff.
6384,0,"I'm starting to get a grasp for when the notification ugliness is going to happen, so it could be an interesting incident notification tool."
6385,0,"however, it doesn't scale. i can use this to track up to a certain number of users. if they target a user i'm not looking at, won't work."
6386,0,"it would be possible with a super low retention for graphs, i guess, and *.wsp files that are deleted if they aren't updated in N minutes?"
6387,0,"but that seems gross, and not really how this tool should be used. can do better w/other things, this is more for an overview."
6388,0,@cheeseplus @obfuscurity wsp is... sigh. but i'm just using docker in aws with a grafana image. fuck configuring this crap.
6389,0,"@cheeseplus @obfuscurity i got statsd/graphite working on freebsd once, but then i switched to connected line graphs and it crashed?!"
6390,0,@cheeseplus @obfuscurity i don't wanna devops this. i just want it to work so i can do other things. i need a devops.
6391,0,"@cheeseplus yeah. i'm kind of feeling like for what i'm doing, wsp is ok. for doing more granular monitoring, redis would be good."
6392,0,"@cheeseplus no pretty graphs easily generated out of redis, tho. i'd have to learn R or somesuch."
6393,0,@Sir5000 @StormsOnSaturn oh dear
6394,0,"@Sir5000 @StormsOnSaturn no. something went awry, box ran out of memory. it's also a dev box."

6397,0,@vex0rian @Sir5000 @StormsOnSaturn or it's not responding to kill signals. weeeeird. because i ran the script manually and it worked.
6398,0,@vex0rian @Sir5000 @StormsOnSaturn getting into inst is slow. it's oomed. prob going to have to aws console and kick it.
6399,0,@ctmf they are already setting up  bots to tweet with the hashtag to inflate it. i don't really see this making much of a difference.
6400,0,"@ctmf but if they do, i'm happy to turn my graphs over to twitter's abuse department. i don't think the people i'm watching would risk that."
6401,0,@Faythemage @motavate i love those too much. TOO MUCH.
6402,0,"So, I guess I need new jeans. Or a belt. Or maybe just some cat5, if I'm keeping it real. http://t.co/06ApCFGDF0"
6403,0,"@Spacekatgal this is more from a consumer side, though. from a business side? one could see email SPAM as falling under that category."
6404,0,"@Spacekatgal and businesses often pay for solutions like that. i have no problem charging businesses, just individuals."
6405,0,"@tomdcc multiple gmail accts. this is all a lot of effort, though. most trolls just pick a new target."
6406,0,"@tomdcc nothing will ever be perfect, but this is a good start towards fixing a HUGE percentage of harassment."
6407,0,@Spacekatgal yeahhhh. they were operating a loss until facebook bought them. fbook didn't buy them to make money off the service.
6408,0,@Spacekatgal it was to get the userbase. and we all know how fbook loves to do social experiments with data.
6409,0,@Spacekatgal twitter allows 13 yr olds. 13 yr olds don't generally have bank accts. *lots* of people don't have bank accts/work in cash.
6410,0,"@Spacekatgal $1 may not seem that far out of reach to a lot of people in the US, but we're also far removed from the class it would impact."
6411,0,@Spacekatgal 80% of his points are bullshit taken from white cis male standpoint. no harassment on fbook? pft. providing ID/addy? NOPE.
6412,0,@Spacekatgal the client/web experience being similar are key. i don't know if twitter client has the additional controls verified accts have
6413,0,@limbclock i wouldn't do that.
6414,0,@sschinke @teh_maxh what are you talking about?

6417,0,"@MaxwellTolvo @Spacekatgal they don't do this right now. i mean, unless you are becoming verified."
6418,0,@tomdcc i met with them weeks ago. :P  who knows what they might do? i certainly don't. but we're talking.
6419,0,@sschinke @teh_maxh it sets a bad precedent.
6420,0,"@sschinke @teh_maxh as a guess, anyways."

6618,0,DoS/DDoS doesn't refer to a technique or method of transport.  It's largely defined by intention + end result.  This is not rocket surgery.

7649,0,"Oh, hell. Is Blizzard proxying tweets instead of sending the tweet content directly to twitter from the WoW client?"
7650,0,I guess that's one way to get around the user token count limitation per app ID.
7651,0,I need to think about this. I don't think I like this.
7652,0,I think the biggest problem I have with it is that there's too much of a reliance on WoW services for an external mechanism.

7758,0,@PeerWorker this is what you just said. you just compared online harassment to mutilated bodies. this is demeaning.

7761,0,I appreciate every donation received. But ppl that threaten to pull funding if I don't say the things they want to hear can fuck themselves.
7762,0,@PeerWorker @krisaubuchon holy shit. seriously? i've done research into both groups. I've seen the tweets &amp; patterns. GamerGate isn't ISIS.

7885,0,"Until twitter provides us with a way to filter new accounts or provides a higher barrier to entry, these are just words that mean little."
7886,0,The Developer Policy needs an update that allows us to filter non-promoted tweets. Twitter clients continue to have bugs w/large block lists

7988,0,ie: they will still feel this way in 5 years. lollll.
7989,0,They also love to add 10 years to my age. Which doesn't bother me. I grew up envious of UNIX beards.

7991,0,"This might be my favorite tweet by rogue, ever. https://t.co/HhSQGdlHgN  Because he assumes my twitter handle is my UNIX login."
7992,0,"UNIX logins are restricted to 8 characters, darling. FreeBSD uses SVN, not git. I believe SVN history is imported to github."
7993,0,"And then there's this person, who suggests PC-BSD because FreeBSD are all sjws. https://t.co/ubnhhv9yQ0"
7994,0,"PC-BSD is a fork that is mostly funded by iXSystems, the organization that runs FreeBSD marketing. It's a frontend on top of FreeBSD."
7995,0,All that collusion in the BSD community sure is hard to keep track of.
7996,0,"In short, this is the most hilarious GamerGate BSD fail I have ever seen. #FreeBSD #OpenBSD #PCBSD http://t.co/poaOZ93QEf"
7997,0,"btw, guys. I'm an admin of the OpenBSD facebook group. So, you know. COLLUSION."
7998,0,"Oh, yeah. and FreeBSD is the OS that runs on your Playstations. Why so salty?"
7999,0,@iglvzx he expects unix logins to map to github usernames - which they rarely will.
8000,0,@Osw94k I would put cash money on them not understanding your profile pic.
8001,0,@tpw_rules I can prove that my code is in FreeBSD. And there are articles that state that FreeBSD is running on the PS3 and PS4.
8002,0,"@mdesjardins for some parts of the company, yes. a lot of freebsd devs work there."

8019,0,@tmclaughbos @_RogueSt4r but rogue isn't really... dev competent. he thinks all dev happens under github.
8020,0,Watching other BSD devs tell roguestar he's wrong and it is delicious.
8021,0,BSD is a good community. Wandering into it and attacking one of the few women contributors is going to get some people talking.
8022,0,"So, just to save you all some time, BSD is my family. The only negative response GG ever received was from a non-dev."
8023,0,"I have never felt more supported and safe than I do around the FreeBSD developer community. They are amazing, and I love them."
8024,0,The smear tactics aren't going to work. These people have known me for over a decade.
8025,0,"So far, the primary response I've heard from the FreeBSD dev community in regards to all of this is ""how can we help?"""
8026,0,And I've asked them to stay uninvolved. But attacking my work with them? GLHF. You're bringing it on yourself.
8027,0,It's been several years since I've contributed code. This was due to a conflict with an employer. I *asked* for my commit bit to be retired.
8028,0,"But all of these attacks of ""not enough commits"" or ""had a dude do it for you"" or ""slept with people"" proves my point. Thanks for that."
8029,0,@tmclaughbos @_RogueSt4r I think I got mine because no one else wanted to touch the code I was working with. :)

8051,0,"I gave it a 5 second glance, didn't see anything interesting. Getting mad about that is like raging at a livejournal post. Same quality."
8052,0,I only really have the time to respond to mainstream media. Reviewing everything that GG writes about me would be too time consuming.
8053,0,"At least MSM manages to do basic fact checking, like not confusing @ggautoblocker with @theblockbot :P"
8054,0,"@oolon you know this is like the only time a dude's code was ever incorrectly attributed to a chick, ever. :P"
8055,0,Morning news included a story about Twitter safety shutting down ISIS accounts because they threatened @dickc.

8059,0,@ncweaver that's fine. ^.^
8060,0,Had to put off press photog until today. Now I'm back to frantically cleaning &amp; cursing myself for not having time for a haircut.
8061,0,Watching GamerGate mock women that are concerned about appearing at GDC given the threats they've been inundated w/over the past 6 months.
8062,0,Perpetuating a culture where abuse is tolerated and targets of abuse are mocked for speaking out against their abusers.
8063,0,GamerGate is an intimidation mob. Speak up? Get threats &amp; dog-piled. Speak about the threats? Get mocked &amp; dog-piled.

8070,0,"@Jason_Gio meh. :P  thanks for the heads up, but not too concerned about another angry dude on twitter."
8071,0,"@Jason_Gio this is the same dude that thinks that not being allowed to publish an article to a site he doesn't own is ""silencing"""
8072,0,@Jason_Gio so his opinion on being blocked on twitter is probably fairly predictable.
8073,0,@Jason_Gio he was already given my email a while ago by someone else.

8080,0,@KaitlynBurnell beats me. I was sent the screencap.
8081,0,"It's human to react negatively to abuse. Trying to blame someone for reacting to abuse is, unsurprisingly, a tactic of serial abusers."
8082,0,RT @ahtweet: @freebsdgirl How dare you have feelings is a fantastic way to dehumanize someone.
8083,0,"This is commonly found in cases of domestic violence, but it's a favored tactic of GamerGate as well."
8084,0,"It's another form of abuse, but more insidious, because the perpetrators think they are the heroes of this story."
8085,0,"Stand strong. The only comfort I have to give right now is that no one is really listening to this particular group, anyways."

8226,0,I like the way Blizzard is tackling toxic players in Heroes of the Storm. It's a good first step.
8227,0,"Creating a reporting system is difficult, because of the human intervention and level of bias that is involved."
8228,0,"For more egregious cases for harassment, we definitely need to be able to respond to those appropriately. But most toxicity isn't this."
8229,0,"Having a high level of toxicity in your community can lead to more serious cases of harassment and abuse, so we need to tackle this head on."
8230,0,Putting the tools into the hands of users is a GREAT idea. We need more active solutions for protecting ourselves.
8231,0,One of my least favorite things is sending an abuse complaint into the void of a ticketing system and waiting for a human. We can do better.
8232,0,@ELLIOTTCABLE the only info i've got is the kotaku article I just RTed. :)
8233,0,"Gaming companies are rarely *tech* companies. That's not their core competency, but they deal with inordinate amounts of abuse."
8234,0,@Cactus_Soup90 difficult to write those with current limitations of developer policy.
